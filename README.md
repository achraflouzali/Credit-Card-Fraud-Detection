# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This GitHub project focuses on building a model for credit card fraud detection. Before constructing the models, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle, which contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders. 

This repository contains the code and analysis for our Credit Card Fraud Detection project. You can find the interactive Jupyter Notebook here:

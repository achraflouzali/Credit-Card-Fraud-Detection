# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This GitHub project focuses on building a robust and accurate model for credit card fraud detection. Before constructing the models, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle, which contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders.
